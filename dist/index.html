Describe the purpose of a server.
- web page - document that can be displayed in a browser, written in HTML
- website - collection of pages grouped together into a single resource, with
            links connecting them together
- web server - computer that hosts a website on the internet
- hosting provider - service that will host my HTTP web server
search engine - web service that helps me find other web pages
- server - computer/software that stores software and files mean to be served 
- hardware server - connects to the internet and supports data interchange with
                    other devices connected to the web
- software server - hosted files, and HTTP server
- HTTP server - software that understands URLs(web addresses) and HTTP (protocol
                my browser uses to view webpages), it's responsible for processing
                and answering incoming requests
                HTTP server can be accessed through the domain names of the websites
                it stores, and it delivers the content of these websites to the 
                end user's device
Describe the differences between static and dynamic sites.
static web server - computer with an HTTP server, the server sends its hosted files
                    as is to my browser
static websites - sites that return the same hard-coded content from the server 
                  whenever a particular resource is requested
static sites are good when the number of pages is small, and I want to send the same
content to every user
1. user navigates to a page, browser sets an HTTP GET request specifying the URL of 
   its HTML page
2. server retrieves the requested document from its file syst
3. server returns an HTTP response containing the document and an HTTP Response status code
- server for a static site will only ever need to process GET requests, bc the server
  doesn't store any modifiable data, it doesn't change its responses based on HTTP request data
- dynamic sites handle requests for static files the same way static sites handle those requests
dynamic web server -  made up of a static web server, an app server, and a database
                      dynamic because the app server updates the hosted files before
                      sending content to my browser via the HTTP server
                      ex. app server might fill an HTML template with content from a 
                      database to produce the final webpage I see on a browser
dynamic websites - sites composed of a few HTML templates and a giant database
                   where some of the response content is generated dynamically
                   HTML pages are created by inserting data from a database into 
                   placeholders in HTML templates
dynamic sites return different data for a URL based on info provided by the user or
stored preferences
parts of a site that make it dynamic: web application (server-side code that processes HTTP
requests and returns HTTP responses), database, and HTML templates
ex. sports-team manager website where a coach can select their team name and team size
in an HTML form and get back a suggested best lineup for their next game
1. my browser/client sends a request to the web server
   when requesting a file via HTTP, client must provide the file's URL
   ex. 
2. web server searches for the request file in its storage space
   HTTP server checks if the requested URL matches an existing file
3. web server finds the file, reads it, processes it as needed, and sends it to the browser
   or it checks if it should generate the file dynamically
   web server must answer every HTTP request, at least with an error message
Explain why you might need a back-end for your project.
- for dynamic websites
1. browser send HTTP request to the web server; the request includes:
   a. a URL identifying the target server and resource
      ex. an HTML file, a data point on the server, or a tool to run
      ex. browser creates a request to the server using the base URL for the resource
   b. a method defining the required action
      ex. GET, POST, HEAD (get the metadata about a specific resource without getting the body),
      TRACE, OPTIONS, CONNECT, PATCH 
      ex. browser creates an HTTP GET request
   c. additional info encoded with the request
      ex. HTML form data
      GET requests encode data in the URL by adding name/value pairs on the end (URL parameters)
      GET requests can be changed and resubmitted, so they're not used for requests that update data
      POST requests add new resources, the data for which is encoded in the request body
      client-side cookies containing session data about the client, including keys that the 
      server can use to determine their login status and permissions/accesses to resources
      ex. browser encodes the team and player nymber either as URL parameters or as part of the URL pattern
2. requests for dynamic resources are forwarded to server-side code, a web application
   ex. web application processes the dynamic request
   (wen server determines how to handle different URLs based on pattern matching rules defined in its config) 
3. the web app interprets the dynamic request
   the web app reads required information from a database 
   ex. web app identifies the intention of the request to get the best team list based on the URL and
   finds out the required team name and number of players from the URL
   ex. web app gets the required info from the database, using internal parameters to define which players 
   are best and possibly also getting the identity of the logged in coach from a client side cookie
4. the server combines the retrieved data from the database with HTML templates
   ex. web app dynamically creates an HTML page by putting the data from the database into placeholders 
   inside an HTML template 
5. it sends a response back to the server containing the generated HTML
   and the HTTP response goes to the browser
   response contains an HTTP Response status code:
   - 200 OK
   - 404 Not Found
   - 403 Forbidden
   response body to a successful GET request contains the requested resource
   ex. 404 would indicate that the team doesn't exist
6. as part of processing, the browser may discover links to other resources (JS or CSS files)
   the browser will send separate HTTP requests to download these files
   ex. browser processes the returned HTML, sending separate requests to get any other CSS
   or JS file it references
7. web server loads static files from the file system and returns them to the browser directly
header - first part of the request containing useful info
- type of request
- target resource URL 
- URL parameters, short string identifying the specific protocol version
- target/host website
- final line has info about client-side cookies
  the cookie includes an id for managing sessions 
- remaining lines has info about the browser used and the sort of responses it can handle

web app receives HTTP requests and returns HTTP responses
- interactd with a database to get or update info
- sends an email to users to confirm their registration with the site
- site may perform logging or other operations

server-side website code can dynamically create and return other types of files: text, PDF, CSV, etc.
or return data: JSON, XML, etc.
response header has - 
- response code
- Content-Type, charset
- how big the response is
- at the end of the message, the body content
- when the response was generated
- the server
- how the response expects the browser to handle page

- web server has to store the website's files: HTML documents and assets
- why a dedicated web server is more convenient:
1. it's typically more available
2. it's always connected to the internet
3. it can have the same IP address all the time
4. it's typically maintained by a third party
protocol - set of rules for communication between two computers
HTTP - protocol that specifies how to transfer hypertext (linked web documents) between 2 computers
       HTTP is textual and stateless (neither the server nor the client remembers previous communications)
HTTP server can't remember a password that I typed or my progress on an incomplete transaction
(application server is needed for tasks like that)
Explain when you wouldn’t need a back-end for a project.
- for static websites
server-side programming involves choosing which content is returned to the browser in response to requests
- server-side code validates submitted data and requests, uses databases to store and retrieve data,
  sends the correct data to the client as required
- server-side code has full access to the server operating system, and the dev can choose what language
  and specific version they want to use
web frameworks provide simple mechanisms to map URLs for different resources/pages to specific handler functions
(keeps the code associated with each type of resource separate, and I can change the URL used to deliver a 
particular feature in one place without having to change the handler function)
# file: best/urls.py
#

from django.conf.urls import url

from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    // HTTP request with a resource URL of /best will be passed to function named index()
    # example: /best/
    url(r'^$', views.index),
    // HTTP request that has the pattern /best/junior will instead be passed to the junior() view function
    # example: /best/junior/
    url(r'^junior/$', views.junior),
]
the regex allow me to match patterns in the URL

Explain the event loop.
- JavaScript has a single-threaded event loop
- the event loop looks at the call stack and looks at the task queue
  if the call stack is empty, it takes the first thing on the task/callback queue and pushes it onto the stack
  again, the event loop has to wait until the call stack is clear before it can push the callback onto the stack
Understand the origin of the Node.js runtime.
- Node.js allows me to run JavaScript code on a local computer or a server without having to
  go through a web browser
  Node.js rose out a desire to have JS be a language that could be run locally as a standalone application
- Node.js, like JS, runs on the v8 JavaScript runtime engine, taking my JS code and converts it into a
  faster machine code
- server can handle multiple requests at the same time, so non-blocking requests can be made
  using a non-blocking request, I can initiate a request without waiting the response to a different request
  I can initiate requests in parallel
- JS does not block execution but schedules async tasks for later
- JavaScript is singly-threaded, it executes one task at a time within a single thread
  no true parallel execution, task switching is required, concurrency is achieved through async programming (event loop)
- Node module - resuable block of code whose existence does not accidentally impact other code
Write a basic “hello world” application and run it in the console of your machine.
Understand what Node.js really is.
